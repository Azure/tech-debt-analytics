# The application modernisation assessment tooling

## Modernisation for dotnet

> Azure Migrate application and code assessment for .NET allows you to assess .NET source code, configurations, and binaries of your application to identify migration opportunities to Azure. It helps you identify any issues your application might have when ported to Azure and improve the performance, scalability, and security by suggesting modern, cloud-native solutions.

The modernisation tooling for dotnet is available as an extension or a command line tool. The extension is available in the Visual Studio marketplace and the command line tool is available as a dotnet global tool.

### Installation

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-appcat
```

### Targets

Current targets for dotnet modernisation are:

- Azure App Service (Linux) `AppService.Linux`
- Azure App Service (Windows) `AppService.Windows`
- Azure App Service Container (Linux)
- Azure App Service Container (Windows)
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Kubernetes Service (Linux)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (Windows)  

### Usage

The primary function of the CLI is the `analyze` command. This command will analyze the specified project and generate a report with the results. It can be used in interactive mode or arguments can be provided.

```bash
appcat analyze --help
# Saving of args here from running `appcat analyze --help`
# DESCRIPTION:
# Scan and analyze .NET applications source code to identify replatforming and migration opportunities for Azure.
# 
# USAGE:
#     appcat analyze [APPLICATION] [OPTIONS]
# 
# EXAMPLES:
#     appcat analyze
#     appcat analyze <APPLICATION_PATH>
#     appcat analyze <APPLICATION_PATH> --target AppService.Windows
#     appcat analyze <FOLDER_PATH> --source folder --target AppService.Windows
#     appcat analyze <IISSITE_NAME> --source IISServer --target AppService.Linux --config <CONFIG_PATH>
#     appcat analyze <APPLICATION_PATH> --report MyAppReport --serializer html --code --binaries
# 
# ARGUMENTS:
#     [APPLICATION]    Path to the application to be analyzed (could be repo folder, solution or project file path)
# 
# OPTIONS:
#     -h, --help                          Prints help information
#     -e, --extensions <EXTENSIONSDIR>    List of directories separated by ':' and containing exports.json file with
#                                         additional extensibility assemblies
#     -s, --source <SOURCE>               Source which the tool should analyze (Solution, Folder, IISServer)
#     -t, --target <TARGET>               Target toward which the tool should analyze the application
#     -c, --config <CONFIG>               Config file to customize analysis (select binaries, add or modify analysis
#                                         rules)
#     -r, --report <REPORT>               Path or name of the report to be generated after analysis is complete (could be
#                                         folder or file name depending on specified serializer)
#         --serializer <SERIALIZER>       Specifies the format for the report to be used after analysis is complete (HTML,
#                                         CSV, JSON, etc)
#         --non-interactive               When specified, it would only use arguments specified in command line and not
#                                         ask questions. If any required piece of data missing it would stop and print an
#                                         error message
#         --code                          Includes all your code, configs and settings in selected projects
#         --binaries                      Includes all external binary dependencies of selected projects
```

For use in automated processes it is recommended to set the `DOTNET_APPCAT_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` environment variable to `TRUE` to avoid interactive prompts causing errors.

```yaml
env:
# This prevents first startup interactive expectations generating errors for the app cat CLIðŸ‘‡
  DOTNET_APPCAT_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE: true
```

You can then use the `appcat analyze` command with the required arguments to generate a report.

```bash
appcat analyze $appPath --source folder --report $destination --serializer json --non-interactive --code --binaries --target $target
```

## Modernisation for Java

> appcat is a command-line tool from Azure Migrate to assess Java application binaries and source code to identify replatforming and migration opportunities for Azure. It helps you modernize and replatform large-scale Java applications by identifying common use cases and code patterns and proposing recommended changes.

## Java and dotnet shared estimation methodology

Source: [Appcat story points](https://azure.github.io/appcat-docs/cli/#about-story-points_cli-guide:~:text=Zipkin-,A.3.%20About%20rule%20story%20points,-A.3.1.%20What)

> ### A.3.2. How story points are estimated in rules
> Estimating the level of effort for the story points for a rule can be tricky. The following are the general guidelines APPCAT uses when estimating the level of effort required for a rule.
> 
> | Level of Effort | Story Points | Description |
> |-----------------|--------------|-------------|
> | Information | 0 | An informational warning with very low or no priority for migration. |
> | Trivial | 1 | The migration is a trivial change or a simple library swap with no or minimal API changes. |
> | Complex | 3 | The changes required for the migration task are complex, but have a documented solution. |
> | Redesign | 5 | The migration task requires a redesign or a complete library change, with significant API changes. |
> | Rearchitecture | 7 | The migration requires a complete rearchitecture of the component or subsystem. |
> | Unknown | 13 | The migration solution is not known and may need a complete rewrite. |
> 
> ### A.3.3. Task category
> In addition to the level of effort, you can categorize migration tasks to indicate the severity of the task. The following categories are used to group issues to help prioritize the migration effort.
> 
> - Mandatory: The task must be completed for a successful migration. If the changes are not made, the resulting application will not build or run successfully. Examples include replacement of proprietary APIs that are not supported in the target platform.
> - Optional: If the migration task is not completed, the application should work, but the results may not be optimal. If the change is not made at the time of migration, it is recommended to put it on the schedule soon after your migration is completed. An example of this would be the upgrade of EJB 2.x code to EJB 3.
> - Potential: The task should be examined during the migration process, but there is not enough detailed information to determine if the task is mandatory for the migration to succeed. An example of this would be migrating a third-party proprietary type where there is no directly compatible type.
> - Information: The task is included to inform you of the existence of certain files. These may need to be examined or modified as part of the modernization effort, but changes are typically not required. An example of this would be the presence of a logging dependency or a Maven pom.xml.
